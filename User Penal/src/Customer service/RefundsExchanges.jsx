          <h1>RETURNS AND EXCHANGE</h1>
          <p>
            The Messy Corner endeavours to ensure that every transaction at our
            website is seamless. We take great care in delivering our products
            and adhere to the highest quality standards. As a policy, we do not
            entertain returns on products delivered in perfect, undamaged
            condition. A product is only eligible for return under the following
            conditions-
            <ul>
              <li>
                A wrong product has been dispatched and in the event that a
                product does not match the item selected during order
                confirmation
              </li>
              <li>
                If you identify a quality or a manufacturing defect on the
                received product.
              </li>
              <li>If the product is received in a damaged condition.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the product is wrongfully delivered (product doesn't
            match the item in the order confirmation) or if it has a genuine
            quality/manufacturing defect then we extend options for full refund
            or re-fulfillment of your orders!
          </p>
          <h1>Return Process</h1>
          <p>
            1. Our return policy is applicable within 7 days from receipt of the
            product and applicable only for the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Damaged product</li>
            <li>Manufacturing defect</li>
            <li>Incorrect product</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The time frame starts from the date the product was delivered as per
            the confirmation received from our logistics team or courier
            partners. Cancellation cannot be made once the order is placed.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Please send us two images (one of damaged part and one of the
            entire product) of the product for us to ascertain the reason for
            return. You can send us the images on orders@KraftoKart.com from
            where our Quality Assurance team will check the details in reference
            to its eligibility of return.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. We will then get back to you with your Return Request Status
            within 2-3 days of receiving your request mail with pictures. Once
            your return request has been accepted, we will arrange a reverse
            pick up for the product in question. It usually takes about 2-3
            working days for organising a pickup and 7-10 days for delivery at
            our warehouse. Once the merchandise is back at our warehouse, our
            quality assurance team will check the merchandise and the refund
            process will get initiated within 2-3 days of receiving it. It will
            then reflect in your bank account
